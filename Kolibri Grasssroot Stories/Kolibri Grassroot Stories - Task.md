# Kolibri Grassroot Stories - Task

### [i-Saksham - Learn And Teach](http://www.i-saksham.org/about.php) 

#### Background
India is plagued by the education crisis. While the government is taking sincere efforts to improve provisioning of education, constraints especially in the backward areas such as poor availability of teachers, under-resourced schools, multi-grade classrooms, etc. have resulted in poor learning levels time and again.

Apart from this, education systems have largely been around rote learning globally making learning a gruelling task and also eradicating a child’s imagination and ability to rationalise things.

i-Saksham Education and Learning Foundation was established in 2015 by three ex-Prime Minister’s Rural Development Fellows as a response to the challenges of education witnessed by them during their fellowship in Jamui and Munger, two of the extremism affected districts in Bihar.
